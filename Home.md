# Adding languages
Every language version of the site acts independently from the other. You can translate every page from the English version, only some pages, or have completely different pages. [[Learn how|Adding-a-new-language]]


# Modifying navigation sidebar & footer
The navigation sidebar and footer work off a main source, that can be manually edited to be as complex or simple as needed. [Learn how|Page:-Navigation]
